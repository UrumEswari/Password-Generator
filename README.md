# Password-Generator
With the growing trend of hacking attacks, everyone should create different and complex passwords for their diverse accounts to keep them secure. Remembering every password is not humanly possible and noting it down somewhere is not a wise idea. Hence, people take the help of Password generators to create strong and complex passwords for their accounts. To generate such functionality all by yourself, you can take advantage of the function that java offers. Whenever a user is developing an account on a new website, you can use that program to develop a password. To take the safety of the password a notch above, you can enforce such functionality so that it saves passwords in encrypted form. To incorporate this, you need to study the fundamentals of Cryptography and Java Cryptography Architecture.
